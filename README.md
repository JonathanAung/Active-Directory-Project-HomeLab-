<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, Iâ€™m setting up an Active Directory home lab with Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. I'll try to simulate how a domain environment works, how to feed events into a SIEM, and generate telemetry from real-world attacks to help me get familiar with them for future projects/jobs.

<h2>Virtual Box VM Machines used</h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> 
- <b>Windows 2022 Server</b>
- <b>Ubuntu Server Splunk</b>
- <b>Kali Linux</b>

<h2>Installations & Configurations:</h2>
Before we do anything, we want to make sure our Virtual Machines are on the same network. We do this by going to "Tools", then "Network" on the VirtualBox. Once we are there, select NAT-network and click on create. For simplicty purpose, I will be naming the network as "AD Project" and have the IPv4 Prefix as : 192.168.10.0/24 as shown in the diagram. Leave the "Enable DHCP" as it is and once we are done with all that, hit apply.

Change the network to NAT-network: <br/>

<br />
Launch our Splunk Server:
 note: make sure you are on the right network setting by using the command `` ` ip a ` ``
 <br/>

<br />
Awesome, we see that the line "inet 192.168.10.10/24 ... " does indeed reflect our network configurations! <br />
However, if it doesn't reflect the same ip address (which is what happened to me at first), you want to type in <br /> ```sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml`` 
<br />
You want to change your settings from this: <br/>

<br />
<br />
To this (Make sure the indentation are correct!):  <br/>

<br />
 once we are done with it, type ```sudo netplan apply``` to apply our changes and try out our ```ip a``` command once more, and this time the ip should be correct.
<br />
Wait for process to complete (may take some time):  <br/>
